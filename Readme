Once you create a Model it create a database table automatically
i am using MYSQL is also fast in retrieving the data from database 
DELETE: 127.0.0.1:3030/api/recipes/:id

this api used to delete single row in the database

GET: 127.0.0.1:3030/api/recipes?page=1

This is api is used to get all recipes from the 
database and paginate the data 


 GET: 127.0.0.1:3030/api/recipes/:id

 this select a single recipe from the database table

 PUT: 127.0.0.1:3030/api/recipes/:id

 DELETE: 127.0.0.1:3030/api/recipes/:id
